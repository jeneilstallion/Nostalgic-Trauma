On the last day of their imprisonment, I was reunited with them only for them to be murdered in front of me. European soldiers did this cruel act in front of me and I will never forget it. This is what started my life of crime. After this traumatic event, I fell into a deep depression and began inflicting self-harm. My fist victim was my pet cat, thomas.
